# mandelbrot
Automised Production of Mandelbrot-Zooms in GIF Format (Pyhon)

Current Version has german nariable names, I will translate it soon

Function:
Input is a complex nubmer c, output is the series-iteration n at which this complex number can be excluded from Mandelbrotset
loops until n = MAX_ITER - 1
If the Exclusion-Criterium is not reached by then, c is assumed as part of the Mandelbrotset and the function returns MAX_ITER
Also includes Test Code, when function.py is called as main
